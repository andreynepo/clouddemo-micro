# 7. Finalizing and Cleaning up

Here you can see main services and resources that has been created during workshop. You can stop them to avoid extra charging or delete if you don't need them anymore.

If you would like to continue working with these resources, you better stop them rather than delete.

### 7.1. Deleting pods and services
You can delete pods and services, including Load Balancer if you don't need them.

```bash
$ kubectl delete -f $HOME/workshop/clouddemo-micro/kube/clouddemo-micro.yaml
```

```bash
$ kubectl delete -f $HOME/workshop/clouddemo-micro/kube/clouddemo-micro-lb.yaml
```

This could be reverted by re-applying yaml files using **kubectl apply** However Load Balancer External IP address will be different.

### 7.2. Stopping or deleting Kubernetes cluster

Set **Number of Nodes** to 0. Scroll down and press **Scale**.

All worker nodes will be deleted, but cluster will remain. All pods will be in Pending state.

If you will need your cluster again, you can scale your Node Pool to the number you desire. New worker nodes will be created and pods will be scheduled to new nodes.

If you don't need your cluster anymore, you can delete it. **This can't be reverted**.

When you delete a cluster, Node Pools are deleted as well with all worker nodes.

If you didn't delete services prior to deleting a cluster, Load Balancer will not be removed.
