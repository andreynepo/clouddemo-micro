# Oracle JET - Tooltip Component

The **`<oj-sample-tooltip>`** component provides you with a convenient way adding a rich hover activated tooltip to text on your page.  The default content of the component will be marked as a hot-zone. The user can then hover their mouse over this zone to trigger the display of a tooltip.
Note that in many cases you will *not* need to use this component for generating a simple text tooltip, setting the _title_ or _alt_ attributes on many HTML elements will cause your browser to generate a tooltip for you. Therefore this component only really needs to be used where you need a richer tooltip display - for example one that includes a hyperlink. There is no guarantee that the popup generated by this component will visually match the style of tooltip that your current browser may generate from say a title attribute. If necessary, however, you can use styling on the tooltip slot to harmonize the look and feel.

The tooltip content is specified through the use of the **tooltip** slot

By default, the user needs to hover over the content for 1/2 second before the tooltip will display However, you can control this interval using the **openDelay** property.

## Using the Component

To use the component you just need to include it into your page, surrounding the context that you want to be the hot zone for the tooltip.  This will typically be plain text or an image.

Note that the immediate child element of the oj-sample-tooltip must be either `<span>` or a `<div>` otherwise the content will not render (see the code sample below).

### Example

``` HTML
<p>The is a sentence containing a
  <oj-sample-tooltip>
    <span>Tooltip</span>
    <span slot="tooltip">This is the content that will appear in the popup</span>
  </oj-sample-tooltip>.
</p>
```

### Accessibility

This component is conventionally triggered through the use of the mouse only and so is not accessible on its own.  However, you can manually open and close the popup using code that calls the appropriate methods on the component

## Support Information

This component should only be used on plain text and images.  Trying to overlay a popup over input elements or advanced JET components such as charts or tables is not supported.

It is not intended that you should use data entry components within the tooltip display.

This component is an unsupported sample for demonstration purposes only. If you encounter any problems feel free to report them via the Oracle forums and we will do our best to address them, however, note that this will be on a best-effort basis only.
